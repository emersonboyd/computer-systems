In order to build, test and run the program, all you need to write in the console is "make". 

If the "make" command is executed, the hello program should run for a few seconds, at which point a checkpoint will be created. The hello program will be killed shortly after the checkpoint is created, then the restart program will be automatically run and the hello program should resume where the checkkpoint was created.

There should be no limitations with this assignemnt. The hello program will run forever, so just ctrl-c the hello program after restart to quit.
