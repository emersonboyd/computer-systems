In order to run the source code, open MARS and open the file within MARS. Assemble, then run the code, and manually input the game board through the console when it prompts you to do so.

The only limitation with the code is that the game board size is limited to a max of 32 characters, but the code should prevent you from entering any more than 32 characters.
